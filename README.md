persistent-mysql-extra
======================

This package provides additional tunable MySQL queries for persistent. Although esqueleto provides a good interface
for writing several more advanced queries, some queries are simply too db-specific to capture in generic library.
If you are doing a expensive insert/update queries or similar you might want to look at this package. This is an
evolving effort (contributions welcome!).
